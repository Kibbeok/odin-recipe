    <h2>WHY IT WORKS</h3> </p>
        <p>
            <ul>
                <li>Resting the batter overnight is key for developing better flavor.</li>
                <Li>Forget about cold batter: letting it rest at room temperature helps it rise taller as it bakes.</Li>
                <Li>A combination of milk and water gives the Yorkshire puddings extra rise and crispness.</LI>

    <h2>Description</h2>
        <p>Printed recipes for Yorkshire pudding go back as far as the mid-18th century, 
            and the dish likely existed long before that. It's simple—almost primal—in its 
            ingredients and process: Mix together milk, eggs, and flour with a pinch of salt to 
            form a batter ("as for pancakes," according to the 1937 cookbook The Whole Duty of a Woman),
             then pour the batter in a pan that has been greased with the drippings from a roast. 
             Originally, that roast was mutton; these days, it's more likely beef.
        </p>
        <p>
            A Yorkshire pudding works on the same principle as a French pâte a choux, 
            the thin pastry used to make cream puffs, Parisian-style gnocchi, and gougères. 
            Those recipes all start with a high-moisture dough and rely on the power of steam 
            to puff and rise into their light, crisp final forms. Yorkshire puddings and popovers 
            take the same concept to the extreme, using a batter that is so moist that it pours out 
            like cream and puffs up to at least quadruple its volume.   
        </p>
        <p>As with all simple recipes, Yorkshire pudding technique is steeped in rules designed to make you believe it's a tricky, fickle food and that following the wrong recipe or wrong technique will lead to disastrous results.
            After dozens of tests and hundreds of puddings, I have some good news for you: 
            It's nearly impossible to mess up a Yorkshire pudding (despite the fact that 
            I managed to back in my fraternity chef days). You can play with the ratio of 
            ingredients every which way and still end up with a batter that rises tall. 
            You can bake it in any type of pan you'd like. You can rest the batter or bake it fresh. 
            You can chill it or leave it out at room temperature. 
            Heck, you can even break the cardinal rule of Yorkshire puddings and pour the batter 
            directly into a cold tin. Break every one of these rules and your puddings will still 
            puff and turn out light and crisp.
        </p>
        <p>But of course, some puddings are lighter and crisper than others. 
            I considered it my duty to investigate each and every rule and theory in the lore of 
            Yorkshire pudding to figure out which ones rise to the top and which are simply puff 
            pieces.

        <h2>Ingredients</h2>
            <ul>
                <li>4 large eggs (200g; 7 ounces)</li>
                <li>150g all-purpose flour (5.25 ounces; about 1 cup plus 2 teaspoons)</li>    
                <li>2g kosher salt (about 1/2 teaspoon)</li>    
                <li>25g water (0.85 ounces; 1 tablespoon plus 2 teaspoons)</li>   
                <li>100ml beef drippings, lard, shortening, or vegetable oil (about 1/2 cup)</li>   
            </ul>
        
        <h2>Directions</h2>
        
            <ol>
                <li>Combine eggs, flour, milk, water, and salt in a medium bowl and whisk until a smooth batter is formed. Let batter rest at room temperature for at least 30 minutes. Alternatively, for best results, transfer to an airtight container and refrigerate batter overnight or for up to 3 days. Remove from refrigerator while you preheat the oven.

                    <br> </br>
                <li>Adjust oven rack to center position and preheat oven to 450°F (230°C). Divide drippings (or other fat) evenly between two 8-inch cast iron or oven-safe non-stick skillets, two 6-well popover tins (see notes), one 12-well standard muffin tin, or one 24-well mini muffin tin. Preheat in the oven until the fat is smoking hot, about 10 minutes.</li>
                <br> </br>
                <li>Transfer the pans or tins to a heat-proof surface (such as an aluminum baking sheet on your stovetop), and divide the batter evenly between every well (or between the two pans if using pans). The wells should be filled between 1/2 and 3/4 of the way (if using pans, they should be filled about 1/4 of the way). Immediately return to oven. Bake until the yorkshire puddings have just about quadrupled in volume, are deep brown all over, crisp to the touch, and sound hollow when tapped. Smaller ones will take about 15 minutes, popover- or skillet-sized ones will take around 25 minutes.

                <br> </br>
                <li>Serve immediately, or cool completely, transfer to a zipper-lock freezer bag, and freeze for up to 3 months. Reheat in a hot toaster oven before serving.</li>
